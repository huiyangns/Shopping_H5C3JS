# Online shopping website static pages

## Project Description
1. This project includes three static pages of an online shopping website.
2. These three static pages include index.html, which is the main page, list.html, which shows some specific products, and register.html, which is registration page.

## Technical Choice
HTML5 + CSS3 + JS + jQuery
### Bright spots in technology
1. It includes TDK tag for SEO.
2. Execute layout manually.
3. Using jQuery implements side navbar which has an elevator navigation effect. When user scrolls down the page, it will appear on the left.
4. Using jQuery deals with sprite pics layout. So we do not need specify pics' postions one by one manually.
